The Dark Mode Light Mode project is a React application that allows users to switch between dark and light themes. Using React's state management, the app dynamically changes the UI colors and styles based on user preference. This enhances user experience by providing a visually comfortable interface in different lighting conditions. The app saves the user's theme preference, ensuring a consistent experience across sessions.
